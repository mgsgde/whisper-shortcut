  <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
  <p>The contents of this website have been created with care. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As the service provider we are responsible for our own content on these pages under applicable law. We are not obligated to monitor third-party information transmitted or stored, or to investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. Liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the relevant content promptly.</p>

  <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
  <p>This site may contain links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no control. We therefore assume no liability for external content. The respective provider or operator is responsible for the content of linked pages. Links were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not apparent at that time. Permanent monitoring of linked pages without concrete evidence of infringement is not reasonable. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links promptly.</p>

  <h2>Copyright</h2>
  <p>Content and works created by the site operator on these pages are subject to applicable copyright law. Reproduction, processing, distribution, and any use beyond the limits of copyright require the consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are permitted only for private, non-commercial use. Where content was not created by the operator, third-party copyrights are respected and third-party content is marked as such. If you become aware of a copyright infringement, please notify us. Upon notification, we will remove such content promptly.</p>

  <h2>Data Protection</h2>
  <p>Use of this website is generally possible without providing personal data. Where personal data (e.g. name, address, or email) is collected, this is done on a voluntary basis where possible. Such data is not passed on to third parties without your explicit consent. Note that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. by email) may have security gaps; complete protection against access by third parties cannot be guaranteed. We object to the use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation for sending unsolicited advertising or informational material. The operator reserves the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited advertising (e.g. spam).</p>
