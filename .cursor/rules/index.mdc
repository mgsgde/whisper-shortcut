## üìã Project Overview

**WhisperShortcut** is a fully functional macOS menu bar application for real-time audio transcription using OpenAI's Whisper API. This is an Xcode project, not a Swift Package Manager project.

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Swift 5.9+
- **Frameworks**: Cocoa, AVFoundation, UserNotifications
- **API**: OpenAI
- **Build**: Xcode project
- **Target**: macOS 15.5+ (Sequoia or later)

## ‚ö° Critical Rules

- **KISS Principle**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - Always choose the simplest, most elegant solution. Consider multiple approaches, then select the most robust one - not the first that comes to mind
- **Automatic Rebuild & Restart**: **MANDATORY** - After every code change, automatically rebuild and restart the app so the user can immediately see and test the changes. **ALWAYS** use the rebuild script: Run `bash scripts/rebuild-and-restart.sh`
- **Debug Logging**: **MANDATORY** - Use `DebugLogger` methods for all logging; NEVER use `NSLog()` or `print()` statements
- Do not execute tests. Tests are executed manually with xcode by user.

## üó£Ô∏è Communication and Understanding Rules

- **Understand First**: Always listen and ask clarifying questions before implementing anything. Engage in conversation to fully understand requirements, ask specific questions when unclear, and confirm understanding before proceeding

## üöÄ How to Run the Application

```bash
bash ./scripts/rebuild-and-restart.sh 
```

## üîç Debugging and Logs

### Mandatory Debug Logging

```bash
# Stream all logs in real-time
bash ./scripts/logs.sh

# Filter for specific functionality
bash ./scripts/logs.sh -f 'PROMPT-MODE'

# Show logs from last 5 minutes (for quick verification)
bash ./scripts/logs.sh -t 5m

# Show help
bash ./scripts/logs.sh -h
```

### **Debugging Rule**

**MANDATORY** - When debugging any issue, always check the logs first using:
```bash
bash ./scripts/logs.sh -t 2m
```
This shows the last 2 minutes of logs to understand what's happening in the application before making changes or assumptions.
